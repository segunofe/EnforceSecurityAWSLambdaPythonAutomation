# ============================================================
# Find and Terminate EC2 Instances with SSH Open to the World
# ============================================================
#
# What this script does:
# 1. Finds all security groups that allow SSH (port 22) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
# 2. Finds all running or stopped EC2 instances using those security groups
# 3. Terminates those EC2 instances
#
# Why this matters: Leaving SSH open to the world is a major security risk.
# This is the type of automation you'd build with AWS Lambda to keep your
# environment secure.
